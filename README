kata to show one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in action

To get started you need to install the requirements and syncdb

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py syncdb

To run the first suite of unit tests

python manage.py test ember

As you complete the kata you will need the api documentation

http://django-rest-framework.org/

The goal of this kata is to get everything in the tests.py passing by adding

1.) the needed routes for each django model under test
**start by looking here => codecamp/ember/urls.py

2.) the needed class based rest-framework views
**start by looking here => codecamp/ember/views.py

3.) the needed rest-framework serializers
**start by looking here => codecamp/ember/serializers.py

When you have the basic set of tests passing in tests.py it's time for the advanced stuff

1.) remove the tests.py (not needed anymore)
2.) rename the file in codecamp/ember/advanced_tests.py to tests.py
3.) run "python manage.py test ember" to start the next suite of failing tests

The goal of the advanced kata is to get the tests.py passing by adding

1.) updated routes/views/serializers to handle the following relationships

** sessions has a one-to-many with speakers
** sessions has a many-to-many with tags
** sessions has a one-to-many with ratings

The models.py has the new django model code required as comments so you can focus on the rest-framework

1.) uncomment the model changes mentioned above and syncdb again if required
